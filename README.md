The SKALE Network is an open-source, Ethereum-native multichain network built to scale Ethereum dApps with a focus on high-throughput, fast finality, and **zero gas fee** transactions via the native gas token sFUEL.

## What does SKALE offer?

- **Zero gas fees** - by design, developers and end-users never pay for transactions.
- **Instant finality** - the fastest chain to finality. Time to finality = blocktime.
- **High performance**
  - **Throughput** - Baseline of 400 transactions per second (tps) and up to 700 tps at peak.
  - **High block gas limit** - 280 million block gas limit allowing optimal throughput and complex transactions/smart contracts to be executed.
- **Purpose-built chains** - app-chains and hub-chains for customization and and horizontal scaling.
- **Native bridge** - Fast flexible, offering 18 second finality between chains. Direct support for popular token standards such as ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 with additional flexibility for passing any arbitrary data through the low-level messaging protocol.
- **Native oracle** - decentralized and transaction free oracle enabling developers to read off-chain data.
- **Decentralization and fault tolerance** - chains supported by 16 randomly chosen and rotated SKALE Validator nodes, with a BFT tolerance of 1/3.
- **Layered Blockchain Security** - unique hybrid Layer 1/Layer 2 architecture that partially derives security from Ethereum and with the performance and decentralization of a Layer 1.

## SKALE Block Exprorers 

All SKALE chains use Blockscout as their block explorer, providing access to essential on-chain data, tools to interact with smart contracts, and the ability to view and verify transactions quickly and easily.

## SKALE Portal 

The SKALE Portal is a web-based interface that offers a user-friendly way to transfer assets and data between different SKALE chains and the Ethereum Mainnet, enabling greater flexibility and scalability for decentralized applications.
